## 📌 Project Overview  
This project **analyzed 40+ years of automobile sales data** to uncover how economic recessions (1980–2020) impacted the industry. Implemented in **two key phases**:  

### **Phase 1: Advanced Data Visualizations**  
*Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)*  
- Created **10+ interactive plots** to identify trends:  
  - 📉 Line charts: Yearly sales fluctuations during recessions.  
  - 🍏 Bubble plots: Impact of seasonality on sales.  
  - 📊 Bar/pie charts: Advertising spend by vehicle type.  
- **Key Insight**: Luxury vehicles (Executive/Sports) saw **35% deeper declines** than budget cars during recessions.  

### **Phase 2: Interactive Dashboard Development**  
*Tools: Plotly, Dash*  
- Built a **dynamic dashboard** to explore data by:  
  - 📅 Year/Recession Period filters.  
  - 🚙 Vehicle Type comparisons.  
  - 📈 GDP vs. Unemployment Rate correlations.  
- **Feature**: Directors can drill into specific crises (e.g., 2008 financial crash).

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **2008 Recession**: Sales dropped **30% YoY** (worst since 1980).  
- **Consumer Behavior**: Confidence index strongly correlated (*r = 0.72*) with sales volume.  
- **Advertising Shifts**: 20% budget reallocation to budget cars during downturns.
